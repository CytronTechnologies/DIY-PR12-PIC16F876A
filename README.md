# Display Real Time Clock (RTC) on LCD
Sample source code for DIY PR12. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface with DS1307, getting real time clock (up second) and display it on 16x2 LCD.
Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/9.80 and XC8 compiler for 9.80, you have to change R to Rw.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
